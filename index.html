                My name is Oliver Brewer, and I am a backend web developer with a Bachelor's of Science in Economics from the College of William and Mary." After graduating from college, I attended the UCSD Extension Coding Bootcamp and received training in the art of coding and web design. During my time in the bootcamp, I was trained in both front-end and back-end web development, but I especially excelled at the latter. I am skilled in the use of HTML, CSS Javascript, JQuery, Ajax, and more. After working as a creative copywriter for a local advertising firm and as an IT intern at Callaway Golf, I am ready to put all that Iâ€™ve learned to use. I hope to hear from you soon.
